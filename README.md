# 🌸 Iris Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

## 📌 Objective
- Load and analyze the Iris dataset using `pandas`.
- Create plots using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize insights.

## 🧪 Tasks Completed
- Loaded dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris`.
- Explored structure, types, and cleaned data.
- Computed descriptive statistics and grouped means by species.
- Created 4 visualizations:
  - Line chart of average features
  - Bar chart (petal length per species)
  - Histogram (sepal length)
  - Scatter plot (sepal vs petal length)

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Virginica** species has the largest average petal size.
- **Setosa** is clearly separable based on petal length.
- Strong correlation between sepal and petal lengths.

## 📁 File
- `Iris_Data_Analysis.ipynb` – Contains code, charts, and results.

## 🔗 Dataset
- Built-in `sklearn.datasets.load_iris` dataset.
